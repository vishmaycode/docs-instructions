I've found the solution for that. Actually, ParrotOS uses different files for source package links. 
If you open and see the file in sources.list by typing /etc/apt/sources.list everything is commented and there are no deb or deb-src links in it. All the links are stored separately in the sources.list.d folder see the files in it by typing 

ls /etc/apt/sources.list.d 

there exists a file for each source package. First change to root user.If you want to add new src link, 

you have to create a new file in that folder <name>.list and add the link to it. 
Suppose if you want to add vs-code to the sources.list, 

then create a file named vscode.list in sources.list.d directory 

and add the link deb http://packages.microsoft.com/repos/vscode stable main to it. 

Finally update by doing sudo apt update and then install sudo apt install <package-name>. For the vscode example use sudo apt install code.

Remove balena etcher


sudo apt-get remove balena-etcher-electron
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/balena-etcher.list
sudo apt-get update
